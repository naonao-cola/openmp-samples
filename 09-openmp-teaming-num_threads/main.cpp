 * @brief Illustrates how to use the num_threads clause.
 * @details This code generates three parallel regions. The number of threads to
 * use for all parallel regions has been set to 4 by the omp_set_num_threads
 * function. This value will be overwritten for the second parallel region only,
 * using the num_threads clause.
