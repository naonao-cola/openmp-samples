/**
 * @brief Illustrates how to use an atomic construct.
 * @details This application consists of 4 threads incrementing a shared
 * variable. This situation is a classic data-race configuration, but the atomic
 * construct guarantees correctness by making sure the variable is accessed
 * atomically. In a nutshell, altough we still do not know in which order the
 * increments are done, we are certain they do not corrupt each other. This
 * situation is to illustrate the atomic construct, in real-world codes, you
 * will want to use a reduction clause instead.
