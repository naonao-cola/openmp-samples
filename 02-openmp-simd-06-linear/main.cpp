/**
 * @brief Illustrates the OpenMP linear policy.
 * @details This example shows that when a linear variable is passed to a
 * parallelised for loop, the value of that variable is the original value plus 
 * the iteration logical number times the linear-step. After the OpenMP parallel
 * for, the value of the original variable is that of the linear variable at the
 * last iteration.
