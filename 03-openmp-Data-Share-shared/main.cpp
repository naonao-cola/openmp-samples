/**
 * @brief Illustrates the OpenMP shared policy.
 * @details This example shows that a variable passed as shared to a parallel
 * region is shared across all threads of that region. It becomes visible by
 * letting a thread modify its value, and another thread prints its value
 * afterwards. The whole process is made more visible by also printing the value
 * of the original variable before and after the OpenMP parallel region.
