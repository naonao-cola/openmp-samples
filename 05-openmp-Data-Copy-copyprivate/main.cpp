/**
 * @brief Illustrates how to use the copyprivate clause.
 * @details This application passes a variable as firstprivate to a parallel
 * region. Then, a single construct receives this variable as a copyprivate and
 * modifies its values. All threads print the value of their own copy before and
 * after the single construct. Although each thread has its own copy, the
 * copyprivate will have broadcasted the new value to all threads after the 
 * single construct.
