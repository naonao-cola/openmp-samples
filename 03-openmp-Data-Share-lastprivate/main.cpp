/**
 * @brief Illustrates the OpenMP lastprivate policy.
 * @details This example shows that when a lastprivate variable is passed to a
 * parallelised for loop, threads work on uninitialised copies but, at the end
 * of the parallelised for loop, the thread in charge of the last iteration
 * sets the value of the original variable to that of its own copy.
