/**
 * @brief Illustrates how to use the omp_set_num_threads function.
 * @details This code generates two parallel regions. The first one will use the
 * number of threads contained in the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS. The
 * code then overwrites that value for all upcoming parallel regions by calling
 * the omp_set_num_threads function and using 1 more thread than what was used
 * for the first parallel region. Finally, it creates a second parallel region
 * to show the difference in the number of threads.
